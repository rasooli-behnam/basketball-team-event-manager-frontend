# basketball-team-event-manager-frontend

This is a project for my diploma course final assessment.

## The project scenario:

The client is an (adult) basketball team who play together every week.
This team often have trouble keeping up with who paid the court fees for which game.
They want some software developed that will let them communicate when their games are
scheduled and who has paid court fees for which game.
Ultimately the client would like a mobile app developed, but for now are happy for prototype / proof
of concept software to be developed in/on ANY technology.
They want the software to do/enable the following and / or meet these requirements:

### Pass Requirements

- Use their google account log in to access the system.
- When the team manager (an authorised member) of the team learns the fixture details, they
  can enter the time, date and venue of games into the system.
- Team members can see on the software the details of any future / upcoming (not past)
  games.
- Have source code available on Github so future developers can access it easily.

### Credit Requirements

- After a game, any team member can enter who paid the court fees and the dollar amount
  they spent.
- Team members can view who a listing of past games and drill down to view who paid court
  fees for each game and how much they spent.
- If a game is forfeited a team member can delete the game from the system.

### Distinction Requirements

- Team members can view a list of all members and the total amount they have spent on
  court fees (total for all time, no need to filter date period etc)
- When a new player tries to log into the software for the first time with their google account,
  they are added to list of accounts pending approval. They cannot view game or payment
  details until their account has been approved by an existing team member.
- Any team member can view a list of new player accounts pending approval, and either
  approve or reject them, in which case they move to authorised or rejected status
  accordingly

### HD Requirements

- Meet any last-minute changes to requirements made by client.
- Have at least one of the following documents for the software produced
  o ERD and / or Class Diagram as appropriate.
